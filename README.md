# [Project 1: Why are the 2021 Giants better than expected? Project Overview][https://github.com/cremmers/data-science-projects/tree/main/giants]
The 2021 Giants baseball team was expected to finish in third place in the National League West division. Instead, they are in first place. The goal of this project is to take a look at the projected statistics for the hitters and pitchers on the team and compare them to the actual stats from the 2021 season. By looking at the numbers, some insight can possibly be found into why the team is better than expected.
